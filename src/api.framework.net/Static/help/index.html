            <li>Capability of writing APIs with multiple backend operations.</li>
            <li>Capability to write almost all types of input validations with configuration.</li>
            <li>Capability to add custom validation by writing a code function and integrating into API with configuration.</li>
            <li>Capability to add a coded backend where you can write any code and integrate with a API endpoint.</li>
